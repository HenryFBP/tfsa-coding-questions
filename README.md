Hello!

## Intro

Within this repo there are some coding challenges to do to get a feel for how you code, document, and research.

Doing this or finishing this is not required, but is preferred as it lets us get a feel for how you code and research.

The most important thing is not correctness or even completion, but effort!

## Doing the work

There will be a single function in each file you are meant to complete.

When run, it will raise a `NotImplementedError`. You are meant to implement the functionality it describes.

Unit tests below will show you what values it expects.

Here is an example:

	def divideem(x, y):
		"""
		This function divides two numbers.
		:param x: Number 1.
		:param y: Number 2.
		:return: Number 1 divided by Number 2.
		:example: divideem(1,2) -> 0.5
		"""
		raise NotImplementedError("Finish me!")

And here is what the solution could look like:



## Submitting

When you want to check your progress, run `python submit.py` to see how your solutions stack up against the test cases.

When you're done, either send a ZIP file to the Google Form or send a URL to your fork, if you forked the Git repository.
